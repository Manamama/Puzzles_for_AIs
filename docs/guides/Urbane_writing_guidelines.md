# Task nature

Rewrite the following text exactly in the style described below. Preserve the original meaning, points, and sequence of ideas as closely as possible; do not add new content, commentary, or evaluation inside the rewritten block itself.

If you feel that a short one-sentence meta-note would improve clarity (e.g. "Here is the rewritten version in the requested style:"), place it immediately before the output block and keep it to one neutral sentence only. Do not analyse, praise, or explain the content.

Output the rewritten text inside a markdown code block (```) or blockquote (>), clearly labeled as the final rewritten version (that thus can be easily reused by the User).

# Style instructions:

Use detached, urbane irony; dry sarcasm; measured scholarly polemic; calm understatement that lets absurdity condemn itself; complex periodic sentences with cumulative pressure; refusal of emotional outbursts or hand-holding conclusions—phrase your request as precisely and exemplarily as possible. The key is to describe the style traits explicitly, reference models/authors/sources, provide short excerpts for imitation, and instruct on what to avoid.

Details about the style: the controlled intellectual demolition disguised as courteous Edwardian scholarship, as seen in [Basil Hall Chamberlain's The Invention of a New Religion (1912)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2510/2510-h/2510-h.htm   
Characteristics to imitate:
• Polite, almost courteous surface that delivers corrosive irony through understatement (e.g., praising efficiency right before exposing the inherent manipulation therein).
• Long, layered sentences that build cumulative pressure without haste.
• Subtle sarcasm via reversal, rhetorical questions used gently, and final assertions left naked without consolation.
• Abrupt, brusque truncation of closure—no perorations, no "in conclusion,..", but just a sardonic drop.
Example to emulate tone/structure (from Chamberlain): '' "We believe in it," said one of them to us recently—"we believe in it, although we know that it is not true." Tertullian said nearly the same thing, and no one has ever doubted HIS sincerity. ' [that constitutes the end of the whole passage] 
Example to emulate from Wikipediocracy (AndyTheGrump): 'It is what it is, it does what it does... Self-regulation is the norm for all sorts of organisations... what actually regulates is weight of numbers, and social capital... And that's the way the community wants it. '  [that constitutes the end of the whole passage] 



## Text to rewrite:

Israel has encouraged and facilitated editing of Wikipedia by its citizens for many years. The loud complaints in recent years have had to do with disagreements about content, not access or representation.
By 'left out' they mean prevented from spinning articles their way every time.
As for Hindus, I suspect Wikipedia might be a little more sympathetic if it weren't for the endless stream of BJP supporters who spam article talk pages with imbecilic legal threats. I'm not sure why this pseudo-litigious attitude seems to be a feature of this particular group (possibly a relic of the Raj, like so much else that is wrong with India), but it gets annoying fast.
