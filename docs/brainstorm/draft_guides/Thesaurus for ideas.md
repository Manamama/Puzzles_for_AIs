a generalized, conceptual heuristic for using me like a “meta-thesaurus” or “AI thesaurus” on ideas, metaphors, or conceptual clusters, not just words. Here’s a structured abstraction of the process you instinctively followed with the paremias:

1. Define the Context and Goal

Identify the target concept or domain: what idea, argument, problem, or artifact are you working on.

Determine the goal of the exploration: Are you seeking critique metaphors? Analogies? Alternative framings? Illustrative phrases?

List keywords or semantic anchors from the context (these are your mental “nodes” to navigate around).

Example: “Graph-laden tl;dr with shaky foundation” → keywords: foundation, argument, graphs, critique.

2. Identify Conceptual Domains / Semantic Neighborhoods

Break the concept into semantic clusters: physical metaphors, computational models, social analogies, literary tropes, etc.

Map domains that naturally connect to the concept.

Ask: In what areas of knowledge or culture do similar structures, processes, or phenomena exist?

Example: Foundation → architecture, geology, engineering, fragile structures.
Argument → logic, computation, storytelling, building blocks.

3. Gather Classical and Modern References

Pull from existing adages, idioms, technical metaphors, literary metaphors.

Include both:

Time-tested phrases (proverbs, adages, classical imagery)

Modern or playful metaphors (technical, pop culture, visual, or experimental).

Keep both literal and figurative mappings in mind.

Example: Sandbar, house of cards, smoke and mirrors, GIGO, Jenga tower logic.

4. Apply Pattern Matching / Conceptual Mapping

Identify underlying pattern templates:

Structural stability: “X built on Y”

Fragility or collapse: “X of Y” / “thin ice” / “house of cards”

Illusion vs reality: “smoke and mirrors” / “paper tiger”

Map candidate metaphors to the context. Don’t just match words — match conceptual functions: what does this metaphor do cognitively or rhetorically?

5. Explore Semantic Extensions / Heuristic Expansion

Ask: What else is fragile, unstable, misleading, or collapsible in the mapped domains?

Use analogy, lateral thinking, and conceptual blending to invent new variants.

Keep a “clustered brainstorm”: separate domains and functions, then cross-combine.

Example: Cracks in foundation (engineering) + Jenga tower (game analogy) → “Jenga tower logic.”

6. Filter by Relevance, Punchiness, and Natural Fit

Remove metaphors that:

Don’t map clearly to the original context

Are overly moralistic or generic

Are culturally obscure or would confuse the reader

Keep metaphors that are transparent, evocative, and immediately meaningful.

7. Optional: Rank or Organize

Rank by: clarity, impact, novelty, or conceptual “fit.”

Organize into primary vs secondary clusters: obvious choices vs playful/creative variants.

Example: “Laid on a sandbar” (primary), “Jenga tower logic” (secondary but playful and precise).

TL;DR of the Heuristic

AI Conceptual Thesaurus Play: Context → Domains → Classical + Modern References → Pattern Matching → Conceptual Expansion → Filter → Rank/Organize

It’s like navigating a semantic multiverse: your anchors are the context keywords, your streets are conceptual domains, and your goal is to “harvest” metaphors, adages, or analogies that map functionally to your target.
