Okay, let's analyze these images.

**Invariant Elements:**

*   **The central white dot/circle:** This is a consistent element in every frame - it appears to be the center of rotation for all subsequent changes.
*   **Background Color**: The background color remains constant throughout—black.

**Changes Across Images (Progression):**

1.  **Image 2-3:** A spiral begins to form around the circle from an unknown point on the edge of the image and grows outward with increasing density as each successive step takes place.
2. **Images 4 onwards:** As more steps are taken, dots begin to appear along this growing spiral shape; they move outwards while maintaining their relative position within the overall structure of the animation. Each new ring adds another layer of circles that grow larger than those before them until eventually forming a full circular pattern across many frames. It looks like we’re watching something unfold into existence!

**Inferred On-Screen Action & Explanation:**

Given what I see:

*   A simple particle system or simulation where objects start at one end and expand out through space based upon time incremented by each individual frame.
*   Each object maintains its distance from the origin during expansion – thus creating spirals which look increasingly complex over time due to increased numbers being added onto existing structures rather than just adding additional points/circles randomly placed without any order whatsoever because everything is connected together in some way - it' "growing" towards completion but still showing change incrementally so no two identical images exist side-by-side except for slight variations caused when viewed sequentially (e.g., changes might be too fast).
