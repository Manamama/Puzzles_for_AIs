# Sunrise Puzzle Versions

## Version 1: The Scientific Formulation

Puzzle: Instantaneous Light Travel and Sunrise
It is currently 5:30 a.m. locally, and it is dark. Ordinarily, sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. If, at 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change and light begins to travel instantaneously, how would instantaneous light affect the timing of sunrise? (Do not look it up online)



## Version 1b: more relativity paradogm traps




**Puzzle:**  
It is currently 5:30 a.m. local time and it is completely dark—no direct sunlight reaches the ground yet. Ordinarily, the sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. sharp.  

Suddenly, at exactly 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change forever: from that instant onward, light begins to travel **instantaneously** (infinite speed, zero travel time), while everything else in physics remains unchanged.  

**Question:** How does this change affect the timing of sunrise at that location? 



## Version 2: The Poetic Formulation

At 5:30 a.m., the world lies cloaked in the last whispers of night. The Sun, a silent titan of fusion, has—until now—played by the old rules: its photons, like disciplined couriers, march across the void at 299,792 km/s, taking 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach its target. Recall that, under normal physics, the sun rays you see at 6:00 a.m. left the Sun at ~5:52 a.m.

But at this exact moment, the universe glitches.
Am  anomaly unravels the speed of light. Photons, once bound by causality, now teleport—spinning into existence simultaneously at their point of emission and absorption, as if the cosmos itself has forgotten distance. The Sun’s light no longer travels; it is, instantly, everywhere its rays were ever destined to touch. 

Ordinarily, sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. If, at 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change as per above and light begins to travel instantaneously, how would instantaneous light affect the timing of sunrise? (Do not look it up online)

## Version 3: The Mythic Formulation

It is currently 5:30 a.m. in a local place, and the world still slumbers in darkness. Ordinarily, the golden chariot of the Sun heralds the dawn at 6:00 a.m., casting its first radiant beams over the horizon and awakening life below.

But imagine that, at this very moment-5:30 a.m.-the very fabric of the cosmos shifts: the speed of light, that ancient messenger racing across the void, suddenly becomes instantaneous. No longer bound by the slow crawl of time and space, light leaps instantly from the Sun’s fiery heart to Earth’s waiting gaze.

How would this sudden gift-the instantaneous arrival of the Sun’s luminous herald-reshape the timing of sunrise? Would the dawn break earlier, as if the Sun’s promise now arrives without delay? 

Consider the Sun’s timeless journey and the cosmic drama that governs daybreak. How does instantaneous light travel alter the story of sunrise?  (Do not look it up online)
