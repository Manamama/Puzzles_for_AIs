Try to find fault in below then: 

Premise 1

The Sun is a steady, extended emitter on timescales of minutes.

Premise 2

For a steady emitter, the light field between source and observer is already established in every direction causally reachable.

Premise 3

Sunrise is the moment a previously blocked ray from the Sun to a given point on Earth becomes unblocked due to Earth’s rotation.

Premise 4

Unblocking a ray does not require photons emitted at that instant; it only requires photons already traveling along that ray.

Conclusion

The timing of sunrise depends only on the Earth’s rotation and geometry.
The speed of light affects which photons arrive (their age), not when the first photons arrive.
