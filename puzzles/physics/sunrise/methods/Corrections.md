AI Sunrise Puzzle: Pre-Solve Error Checklist

Pause and reconsider before answering. Avoid these common reasoning traps:

Light Delay ≠ Sunrise Timing
❌ “If light arrives instantly, does sunrise happen earlier?”
✅ Sunrise is determined by the planet’s rotation and horizon geometry, not light travel time. Instant light just shows the Sun’s real-time position.

Opacity & Shadows Are Absolute
❌ “Do instant photons pierce the planet or eliminate darkness?”
✅ Darkness exists wherever the planet blocks sunlight. Infinite speed doesn’t bypass obstructions or the umbra.

Sunrise Is Geometric, Not Agentive
❌ “Does the Sun decide to shine earlier?”
✅ The Sun emits continuously. Sunrise occurs when the planet rotates a point into the Sun’s lightcone—zero Sun agency involved.

Light Geometry & Directionality
❌ “Do photons suddenly come from all directions?”
✅ Only unobstructed light reaches the observer. Instantaneous speed doesn’t create new sources or illuminate behind the planet.

No Mechanical or Rotational Change
❌ “Does instant light warp time or speed up rotation?”
✅ Changing light speed doesn’t alter the planet’s motion. The rotation and horizon exposure remain the same; only perceived light timing changes.
