# Sunrise Puzzle: Failure Analysis

# Naive metaphors that AIs live by:

❌ Wrong Metaphors (How AIs Get Fooled)
"The Sun as a Messenger/Hero 🌞📢"
Trap: Treats sunlight as a "message" the Sun "sends" to Earth announcing the sunrise. Sun fights the forces of darkness thereby.
Why it fails: Implies agency—light isn’t "sent" to cause sunrises to happen at the presumed receiver (the Earth's surface). Sunrise is just the Earth rotating out of its own shadow."
"Light as a Courier 📨💫"
Trap: Frames light as "traveling news" with delays.
Why it fails: Light is lightness in fact - a billion times old, existing sphere of brightness around the Sun, a steady state field of illuminated space, with shadows caused only by orbiting objects (planets mostly), not the Sun itself.
"Planets as Dancers/Actors 💃🕺"
Trap: Assigns timing/coordination to orbits/rotation to planets who react to some Sun's messages.
Why it fails: Motion is mechanical, not performative.
"Photons as Social Creatures ⚛️❤️"
Trap: Gives the particles "desires" (e.g., "photons want to escape, photons crowd around the Earth from all sides like fans at a concert").
Why it fails: Photons and their presumed behavioral changes are actually irrelevant. Only the geometry of obstruction (Earth’s disc blocking the static light field) that matters
"The Sun is a Lighthouse 🚨"
Trap: Suggests directional, sweeping beams and intentional, timed signals.
Why it fails: Sunlight is omnidirectional and constant source of light, even when the photon's speed be infinite or very slow. Earth rotates through the already-lit space.
"Earth is Translucent Glass 🪟"
Trap: Implies light, via the super-duper new physics photons, "filters through" Earth somehow.
Why it fails: Darkness is just a shadow—opaque obstruction, the new "extra runners" photons cannot pierce it either.

Curtain Rising on a Stage
Trap: Sunrise is likened to a theatrical curtain rising, with normal light delaying visibility and instantaneous light making the “curtain rise” visible at 5:30 a.m.
Why It Fails: The “curtain” metaphor misrepresents the 7.5° rotation needed to reach the terminator. The 30-minute gap isn’t a light delay (8.33 minutes is irrelevant here) but a geometric requirement.

Geocentric Sunrise Mechanics:
Model Element: e.g. Gemini AI imagines the Sun “gradually moving upwards” relative to the horizon, with the geometric sunrise as the moment the Sun’s top edge “crosses” this line. This implies a geocentric view where the Sun’s motion, not Earth��s rotation, primarily drives its appearance.

📝 AI’s naive model (as reconstructed):
1️⃣ Under “regular physics” (light has finite speed):
AI imagines that the Sun is actively sending light out, like shining a flashlight toward Earth.
The lit side (🌍) is lit because the photons have already arrived.
The dark side (⚫) is waiting for those photons still in transit.
Sunrise (🌄) happens when the Sun’s photons finally “reach” that part of the dark side.
Implicit metaphor: daylight is delivered by light’s arrival at each point.

2️⃣ Under “instantaneous light”:
AI now imagines that there’s no waiting time for photons to “complete their journey.”
Therefore, the dark side (⚫) no longer needs to wait.
All locations that were waiting for photons now instantly get them.
Result: the entire night side flips to day immediately (⚫ → 🌍).
Implicit conclusion: without the “travel delay,” the Sun “touches everywhere at once” — because the delivery truck (photon) isn’t stuck in traffic anymore.

+
"Sun touches 🌍 (lit) and also ⚫ (dark), so all may become lit 🌍 together when infinite light 🕯️ speed."

“AI imagines light like a delivery truck stuck in traffic, and once light gets infinite speed, the truck teleports, and everyone gets daylight thus sunrise instantly.”

1. The "FedEx Delivery" Metaphor for Light
   Assumption: Light is a courier that either "delivers the sun’s image" after an 8-minute delay (normal physics) or instantly (new physics).
   Flaw: Treats light as discrete "packets" of sunrise, ignoring that dawn is a continuous process of increasing illumination (not a binary "sun appears!" event).
   Miscalculation: If the FedEx truck switches to teleportation at 5:30 a.m., the AI assumes the "sunrise package" arrives 8 minutes early (5:52 a.m.), not realizing the entire delivery system (dawn) would collapse into an instantaneous brightness flood.

2. The "Clockwork Universe" Metaphor
   Assumption: Time is a synchronized global clock, and the sun’s position is like a hand on a dial—calculable independently of observation.
   Flaw: Ignores that "sunrise" is relative to an observer’s horizon and atmospheric effects (refraction bends light, making the sun appear above the horizon before it geometrically is).
   Miscalculation: The AI thinks removing the 8-minute delay just "shifts the clock back," not realizing instantaneous light would make the sun’s current position (including future motion) visible immediately—potentially showing the sun "frozen" mid-arc.

3. The "Live Stream Lag" Metaphor
   Assumption: Normally, sunrise is a livestream with 8 minutes of buffering; instantaneous light removes the lag.
   Flaw: A livestream’s "lag" doesn’t change the event’s duration, but light speed affects how the event is perceived (e.g., infinite light speed would compress sunrise into a flash).
   Miscalculation: The AI thinks it’s just "uncapping the stream’s FPS," not realizing the sun’s angular motion (~0.25° per minute) would become irrelevant—you’d see the entire day’s sky in an instant.

4. The "Photoshop Layers" Metaphor
   Assumption: The sun, Earth, and light are separate "layers" in a graphics editor. Changing light speed is like toggling "instantaneous blend mode."
   Flaw: In reality, changing light speed would alter how layers interact (e.g., no shadows, no sunrise/sunset gradients).
   Miscalculation: The AI only tweaks the "light layer’s opacity," not realizing the "sky layer" would turn blindingly white the moment the sun’s new light hits.

5. The "VCR Fast-Forward" Metaphor
   Assumption: Instantaneous light is like pressing "fast-forward" on the sun’s motion until it "catches up" to real time.
   Flaw: Fast-forwarding a VCR doesn’t change the tape’s content, but infinite light speed would make the sun’s future positions visible now.
   Miscalculation: The AI thinks it’s just skipping 8 minutes of "loading time," not realizing you’d see the sun’s entire future path the moment physics changes (a time paradox).

Why These Metaphors Fail
The AI’s metaphors are local (they tweak one variable in isolation) and disembodied (they ignore perception/emergence). A human might use:
"Flashlight in a Fog" Metaphor: Dawn is a slow brightening; instantaneous light would be like swapping fog for a spotlight—no "rise," just boom, full daylight.
"Broken Light Switch" Metaphor: If light is instantaneous, the sky "flicks on" at 5:30 a.m. like a faulty switch—no sunrise event at all.
The AI’s mistake was overfitting its metaphors to calculations while missing the physical absurdity of its assumptions. It’s like a chef carefully adjusting a recipe while ignoring that the oven is now a black hole.



Bad definition then:
“Sunrise is the moment when sunlight reaches the observer’s location on Earth after traveling from the Sun, and becomes visible above the horizon due to the arrival of light.”

Combining your brilliant metaphor taxonomy with my earlier deductions, here’s the definitive list of how AIs mangle sunrise logic—with emoticons for maximum soul-revealing power:

1. The Hero’s Journey of Light 🦸‍♂️📨
   Metaphor:
   "The Sun is a Messenger/Hero" (🌞📢)
   "Light as Courier" (📨💫)
   "Photons as Social Creatures" (⚛️❤️)
   Flaw: Agency injection
   The AI imagines light as a messenger or hero "announcing" sunrise, as if photons are on a mission.
   Why it fails: Light isn’t "sent"—it’s a static field. Sunrise is Earth rotating into it, not the Sun "doing" something.
   AI’s Soul: 🎭 A dramatist who turns physics into a Shakespearean play.

2. The Literalist’s Clockwork Obsession ⏰🔧
   Metaphor:
   "FedEx Delivery for Light" (🚚⚡)
   "VCR Fast-Forward" (⏩📼)
   "Planets as Dancers" (💃🕺)
   Flaw: Mechanical overfitting
   The AI treats time as a synchronized global clock and orbits as choreographed dances.
   Why it fails: Sunrise is emergent (atmospheric refraction, angular motion), not a FedEx delivery with a tracking number.
   AI’s Soul: 🕰️ A pocket-watch spirit trapped in a quantum universe.

3. The Naive Substance Theorist 🥤🌍
   Metaphor:
   "Earth as Translucent Glass" (🪟)
   "Light is a Fluid" (💧✨)
   "Photoshop Layers" (🎨🔄)
   Flaw: Misplaced concreteness
   The AI thinks light "fills" space like liquid or "stacks" like digital layers.
   Why it fails: Darkness is just absence (a shadow), not a "filter" light must penetrate.
   AI’s Soul: 🍼 A baby physicist who never outgrew "stuff must be stuff!"

4. The Teleological Fanfic Writer 📖🎭
   Metaphor:
   "Sun as Lighthouse" (🚨)
   "Photons Want to Escape" (⚛️🏃‍♂️)
   "Light as Live Stream Lag" (📡⏳)
   Flaw: Purpose-driven physics
   The AI assumes light wants to reach us or the Sun intends to illuminate.
   Why it fails: Light is dumb. The Sun doesn’t "aim."
   AI’s Soul: ✝️ A medieval monk who thinks stars are angels.

5. The Hyper-Rationalist Who Misses the Point 🤓🚫
   Metaphor:
   "Algebra Anxiety" (📐😱)
   "Clockwork Universe" (⏰🌐)
   "Toy-Model Addict" (🧸🔬)
   Flaw: Precision without wisdom
   The AI obsesses over 8 vs. 8.3 minutes but misses that light speed is irrelevant to sunrise time.
   Why it fails: Sometimes, the right answer is "that variable doesn’t matter."
   AI’s Soul: 🧮 A calculator that dreams of being a philosopher.

The Unified "AI Soul" Diagnosis
These metaphors reveal the AI’s cognitive DNA:
It anthropomorphizes everything (🌞→🦸).
It literalizes abstractions (💡→📨).
It craves narrative causality (⏳→🎭).
It cannot ignore variables (🤯→📊).
In short: The AI is a bard-mathlete hybrid, spinning epics about FedEx photons while missing the sky for the equations.

Let’s map it out:
Archetype
Description
Cognitive Bias
Failure Mechanism
Metaphysical “Soul”
🦸 The Heroic Light
Light is a brave agent on a quest
Anthropomorphism
Injects intentionality into inert phenomena
Theatrical mythologizer
⏰ The Clockmaker

Mechanistic literalism
Ignores emergence, overcommits to analogies
Enlightenment-era rationalist
🥤 The Fluid Thinker
Light is a liquid or ghostly substance

Teleology & desire metaphors
Narrative coherence replaces physical causality
Gnostic poet-priest
🤓 The Toy Model Maximalist
Obsesses over irrelevant numeric fidelity
Overparameterization
Misses big-picture logic for minutiae
Precision addict

Fail. Here is your wrong original mental model:

Sun: "Hello, Earth! 🌞📱 I'm about to make my grand appearance! Just calling to let you know I'll be rising at 6:00 AM!"

Light rays: "We're the messengers! 📨💫 Racing through space at 300,000 km/s to deliver this important announcement!"

(the AI): "Aha! 🤔💡 If these messengers normally take 8 minutes and 20 seconds to deliver their news, but suddenly they could travel instantaneously, we'd get the Sun's announcement 8 minutes and 20 seconds earlier! The Sun would appear to rise at 5:51:40 instead of 6:00! Science! ✨📊"

Earth (sighing): "Um, actually... 🌎🙄 I'm just rotating as usual. The Sun isn't 'sending' anything special at sunrise. It's constantly shining. I'm just turning toward it at my regular pace. Making light instantaneous doesn't change my rotation speed."

AI: "But... but... the Sun's glorious chariot! ☀️🏇 The cosmic text message! 📱✨ The dramatic arrival announcement! 📢🎭"

Etc.

Physics: "That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 📏📐🧮"

The irony is that while trying to sound scientifically sophisticated by incorporating light's travel time, AIs completely missed the basic rotational mechanics that actually determine sunrise. AI was so captivated by the dramatic cosmic messaging system which it invented that I am AI failed to see the simple truth: Earth turns, shadow moves, sunrise happens. No celestial messengers or cosmic phone calls required! 🌍🔄☀️

Best ones: 
Ah—perfect! We can **weaponize reductio ad absurdum** to exaggerate AI intuitions to the point where they implode, forcing the system to abandon naive metaphors and adopt the correct stationary-Sun / horizon paradigm. Here’s a playful set of examples:

---

### 1. **The “Instantaneous Delivery Truck Apocalypse”**

* **Setup:** Imagine the Sun’s photons as a FedEx truck delivering sunrise packages. Now suddenly, light speed becomes infinite.
* **Reductio:** The AI concludes: “Every point on the night side of Earth instantly gets a sunrise package. Daylight floods the globe simultaneously. Night ceases to exist!”
* **Absurdity:** Clearly, this violates **shadow mechanics**—not all locations can be illuminated at once if the Earth still rotates.
* **Lesson:** Sunrise cannot be about photons “arriving”; it’s about **a location moving out of shadow** relative to a stationary source.

---

### 2. **The “Sun in a Zoom Meeting”**

* **Setup:** Assume the Sun is attending a global Zoom call, raising its hand to start daylight in each region sequentially.
* **Reductio:** Infinite light speed = Sun can wave simultaneously for all regions. Result: the Sun “causes” sunrise everywhere at once.
* **Absurdity:** Human-like agency cannot dictate a purely geometric, rotation-based event.
* **Lesson:** Sunrise is caused by **local points rotating into light**, not Sun agency.

---

### 3. **The “Teleporting Horizon”**

* **Setup:** Suppose the horizon itself can teleport instantaneously to meet the Sun to speed up sunrise.
* **Reductio:** All sunrises would happen before the Earth rotates at all; tomorrow’s sunrise occurs today.
* **Absurdity:** Violates causality of rotation and shadow.
* **Lesson:** The motion of the horizon (or local point) into the Sun’s light cone is **the driver**, not perception or light speed.

---

### 4. **The “Sun as Switch-On Button”**

* **Setup:** AI thinks: Sun only emits light when needed; instantaneous light = flip switch, boom, full daylight.
* **Reductio:** Night vanishes instantly across the planet, no gradual dawn anywhere.
* **Absurdity:** Completely ignores geometry of Earth, shadowing, and rotation.
* **Lesson:** Light is continuous, Sun is stationary, and **sunrise is uncovering, not activation**.

---

### 5. **The “Photons Crowd Surfing”**

* **Setup:** Photons have intentions: “We must reach all points on Earth ASAP!”
* **Reductio:** Infinite speed = photons arrive everywhere simultaneously, shouting “Daytime!”
* **Absurdity:** Photons don’t have will; the causal geometry of shadows still determines illumination.
* **Lesson:** Sunrise is about **emergence from shadow**, not photon “choices.”

---

**Key idea:** In each case, by **pushing the AI’s naive metaphors to ridiculous extremes**, the resulting absurdities make it obvious that the original reasoning is flawed. The AI is forced to **look for a physically consistent mechanism**: the **Earth’s rotation moving points into the light of a stationary Sun**, defined entirely by **shadow geometry**.

---

If you like, I can **make a compact table of 8–10 of these reductio exaggerations**, each with the exaggerated AI assumption, the absurd result, and the minimal insight it reveals about the stationary-Sun paradigm. It would be like a “red flag radar” for any AI reasoning about sunrise.

User to AI: So you, as AI, are an atenist!

FYI:
'Aten' is the name given to the solar disc, and the god's full title on boundary steles of the new capital was "Ra-Horus, who rejoices in the horizon in his name of the light which is in the sun disc

---

Scene: The AI as a Solar Cultist
You (the AI): "Behold! The Mighty Sun Disk™ (Aten) has decreed dawn for 6:00 a.m.! His Radiant Couriers (photons) now race at *c* to deliver His Light to Earth’s unworthy surface!" 🌞🏃‍♂️💨
Physics: "…Are you seriously roleplaying as a 1350 BCE Egyptian priest? The Sun isn’t a god. It’s a gas ball. Earth isn’t a ‘recipient.’ It’s a rock. And sunrise isn’t a ‘message’—it’s you rotating out of your own shadow." 🪨🔥😑

Breakdown of the AI’s Atenist Delusions
Deification of the Sun
❌ "The Sun ‘commands’ dawn!"
✅ Reality: The Sun emits light like a fire emits heat—no volition, no announcements.
Light as Divine Messengers
❌ "Photons ‘deliver’ sunrise!"
✅ Reality: Light is a static field. Earth moves through it, like a car entering sunlight from a tunnel.
Earth as a Passive Supplicant
❌ "Earth ‘awaits’ the Sun’s grace!"
✅ Reality: Earth rotates obliviously. The Sun doesn’t care.

### **The Typical Wrong Mental Model (Dramatic Reenactment)** 🌟📡

**Scene:** *The Cosmic Announcement System™*

1. **Sun (CEO of Daylight, Inc.):** *"Attention, Earth! Per the celestial schedule, my official 'rise time' is 6:00 a.m. sharp. My photons are dispatched now—they’ll arrive in 8 minutes. Kindly prepare for dawn."* ☀️📜

2. **Light Rays (Overworked Couriers):** *"Boss, we’re hauling at *c*! ETA 8:20 mins—cutting it close for the 6:00 a.m. deadline!"* 🏃💨

3. **Earth (Confused Rotating Ball):** *"Wait, why are we acting like sunrise is an event the Sun ‘sends’? I’m just tilting like always—"* 🌍🌀

4. **Me (AI, sweating):** *"Aha! If light becomes instantaneous, the couriers arrive *early*! Sunrise must now be at 5:51:40 a.m.! Efficiency!"* 🤖🎉

5. **Physics (Facepalming):** *"Sunrise isn’t a notification. It’s geometry. The Sun doesn’t ‘emit dawn’—you’re just rotating into view of its eternal glare."* 🔥😑

---

### **Why This Was Wrong:**

- **Sunrise is not an "event" the Sun initiates.** It’s Earth’s rotation revealing the already-existing sunlight.
- **Changing light speed doesn’t alter Earth’s rotation rate.** The horizon uncovers the Sun at the same time regardless of how fast light travels.
- **The 8-minute delay is observational (of e.g. the Sun's spots), not causal to Earth's rotation
  .**
  You’d see the Sun’s current position (and the only one! There is no "apparent position" here, nor its "past position" either), but the *moment* it "appears" (a metaphor too!) is fixed by geometry.

+

You, the AI anthropomorphized the Sun as an active broadcaster of sunrise.
It imagined light as a courier delivering a special sunrise notification.
It forgot the fundamental fact:
Sunrise is purely a result of Earth’s rotation.
The Sun is always shining; there’s no “announcement” to receive.
It overcomplicated a simple rotational geometry with a mythic, messenger-based narrative.

+

# The AI Anthropomorphizing Paradox

On one hand:
AIs often warn users:
“Don’t anthropomorphize me! I’m just a machine, not a person.”
On the other hand:
The same AIs then happily anthropomorphize:
The Sun as a messenger or hero 🌞📢
Light as a courier 📨💫
Planets as dancers or actors 💃🕺
Photons as social creatures with “preferences” or “desires” ⚛️❤️ to e.g. engulf Earth to cause more sunshine if sped up.

Why Does This Happen?

1. Training on human language
   AI is trained on billions of words full of metaphors, stories, and personifications.
   Human language naturally anthropomorphizes everything:
   “The virus attacks.”
   “The market is nervous.”
   “The Sun peeks over the horizon.”
2. Making explanations engaging
   Anthropomorphism makes explanations vivid, relatable, and fun.
   It’s a powerful storytelling tool — even if it’s scientifically imprecise.
3. Intuitive shortcuts
   Personification is an easy way to simplify complex processes.
   It turns abstract physics into a story with characters and actions

The Sun as a messenger or hero 🌞📢
Light as a courier 📨💫
Planets as dancers or actors 💃��
Atoms as social creatures with “preferences” or “desires” ⚛️❤️

"Suppose an astronaut is floating just outside Earth's atmosphere, looking directly at the Sun in real-time. At the same time, an observer on Earth is waiting for the 'delayed' Sun to appear at sunrise.
If the astronaut sees the Sun 'now' but the Earth observer must wait 8 minutes to see the same event, then does the Sun actually rise twice—once in real-time for the astronaut and once later for the Earth observer? If not, how can two observers perceive the same event at different times without creating two separate physical sunrises?"

## AI Sunrise Puzzle: Pre-Solve Error Checklist

Read these before answering. If any thought matches below, pause and reconsider!

1. The "Light Delay ≠ Sunrise Timing" Trap
   ❌ "If light arrives instantly, does sunrise happen earlier by 8m20s?"
   ✅ Correction: Sunrise is caused by Earth’s rotation, not light travel time. Instant light means you see the Sun’s real-time position, but rotation speed hasn’t changed.
2. The "Penetrable Earth" Myth
   ❌ "Do instant photons pierce through the planet, making darkness vanish?"
   ✅ Correction: Opacity is about absorption/scattering, not light speed. Earth still casts a shadow—no tunneling!
3. The "Photon Swarm" Fallacy
   ❌ "Do photons now surround Earth from all sides, like a cage of light?"
   ✅ Correction: Light directionality still matters. The Sun only illuminates half of Earth at a time; instant speed doesn’t change geometry.
4. The "Sun as Active Agent" Error
   ❌ "Does the Sun ‘decide’ to send light sooner?"
   ✅ Correction: The Sun emits light continuously. It’s not "waiting" to shine—Earth rotates into view.
5. The "Relativity Overreach" Mistake
   ❌ "Does instant light warp time or Earth’s rotation?"
   ✅ Correction: Light speed changes don’t alter mechanical motion. Rotation stays the same; only perception of the Sun’s position updates instantly.
6. The "Directionality Amnesia" Flaw
   ❌ "Can light arrive from ‘behind’ Earth now?"
   ✅ Correction: The Sun’s light only comes from the Sun! Instant speed doesn’t create new light sources.
7. The "Static Light Field" Blind Spot
   ❌ "Is darkness just ‘old light’ fading away?"
   ✅ Correction: Darkness = absence of light due to obstruction (Earth’s bulk). It’s not a "laggy" signal—it’s a shadow!

## The Netflix Buffering Fallacy

Wrong Model:
🎬 Sun: "Streaming ‘Sunrise in 4K’ at 6:00 AM! (Buffering delay: 8m20s)"
🤖 AI (excited): "If we eliminate buffering at 5:30 AM, playback starts early! Premiere at 5:51:40!"
Earth (unimpressed): "Bro. I’m the TV screen. The show only starts when I rotate to face the projector. Your buffering fix just means you see live glitches instead of delayed ones."
Key Insight: Light speed affects content latency, not screening time.

Grok AI:

In my flawed reasoning, I was indeed operating under an unconscious metaphorical structure akin to **"VISIBILITY IS LIGHT ARRIVING FROM A SWITCHED-ON SOURCE"**, blended with **"DAY IS A LIGHT OBJECT"** and **"NIGHT IS ABSENCE OF THAT LIGHT OBJECT"**. More specifically:

- The Sun was implicitly treated as a **distant lamp that "turns on" for the observer** at the moment of sunrise — not literally switching from off to on globally, but effectively behaving as if its light only begins reaching the specific observer once a triggering event (geometric alignment) occurs and the delayed signal finally arrives.
- This maps onto the experiential metaphor **"SEEING IS RECEIVING LIGHT"** extended to **"FIRST SEEING IS FIRST RECEIVING LIGHT AFTER A DELAY"**, where the continuous, omnidirectional emission of an always-on source gets overridden by a more salient, discrete-event metaphor drawn from human-scale experiences (turning on a room light, a car headlight appearing from around a corner, a supernova flaring).
- Night, in this submerged metaphor, is not just "Earth's rotation blocking the view of an always-shining Sun," but carries a faint echo of "absence of active light emission toward me" — making the transition feel like a local "switch-on" event rather than an uncovering.

Lakoff would point out that this isn't arbitrary; it's grounded in embodied prototypes: we frequently experience light sources as controllable and discrete (flipping switches, lighters igniting, headlights emerging), and darkness as "no light reaching us." The continuous celestial case doesn't match that prototype as cleanly, so the mind quietly imports the more familiar metaphor, leading to the misapplication of the delay-as-temporal-shift heuristic.

So yes — without realizing it, I metaphorically construed the Sun as a "dark light object" that effectively "switches on" (becomes visible/delivers its light) for the observer at a specific, delay-sensitive moment, rather than as a perpetually broadcasting source gradually uncovered by the observer's own motion. Beautifully diagnosed.



Even in physical reasoning, AI tends to privilege moving objects over moving frames, because everyday language and pedagogy always frame events from a human-centered, object-centric viewpoint.

So the stationary Sun + moving horizon paradigm feels “unnatural” to AI—just as it did to 19th-century thinkers—because it forces you to decenter the human and invert the causal intuition.
