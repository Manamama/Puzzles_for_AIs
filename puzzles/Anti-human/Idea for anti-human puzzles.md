**Why this is anti-human:**

* Humans crave narrative; here, narrative interferes with strictly mechanical solution.
* Multiple substrates (words, symbols, numbers) must be manipulated **without semantic reasoning**.
* Combinatorial constraints tempt humans to overthink.

**Why AI can approach it:**

* Purely symbolic / combinatorial.
* No meaning or storytelling required; rule-following suffices.
* Each substrate can be processed independently, then merged mechanically.
