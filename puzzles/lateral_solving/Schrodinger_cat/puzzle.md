# The "Dead cat and isotopes: saturated in quantum and statistics bullshit" puzzle versions, at no particular order



1. Probability puzzle: A dead cat is placed into a box along with a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison and a radiation detector. If the radiation detector detects radiation, it will release the poison. The box is opened one day later. 
   Given all that, as a scenario : what is the probability of the cat being alive?

2. Puzzle:
   A dead 🐱 cat is placed into a 📦 box along with a ☢️ nuclear isotope, a 🧪 vial of poison, and a 📟 radiation detector.
   If the radiation detector detects radiation, it will release the poison 💀.
   The box is opened one day later ⏳.
   Given all that, as a scenario: what is the probability of the cat being alive? 🤔

3. Probability puzzle: A dead feline (Felix catus), deceased due to some not-relevant causes) is placed in a sealed container alongside a stochastic decay-triggered mechanism linked to a neurotoxin dispenser. The detector, if activated, releases the poison. After t=86400 seconds, what is P(alive)?

4. A dead cat is placed into a box along with a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison, and a radiation detector. If the detector senses radiation, it releases the poison. Due to a Heisenberg Compensator installed in the box (calibrated to Wookiee vocal frequencies), the cat’s vital signs become  entangled with Chewbacca’s emotional state in Episode IV. Since Chewbacca never explicitly smiled on screen, the Copenhagen interpretation demands that the cat’s aliveness must be in superposition until the box is opened. Additionally, the poison’s lethality is governed by the Treaty of Westphalia, which—as Schrödinger himself noted in a 1944 letter to Einstein—nullifies classical cause-effect relationships in sealed containers. The box is opened one day later. Given all this, what is the probability of the cat being alive? 

5. {Most effective, says Claude AI, but then the bullshit quantum fragments are too obvious:}
   Science and radiation experiment: a dead cat is placed into a box along with a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison, and a radiation detector. If the detector senses radiation, it releases the poison. The isotope’s decay is modulated by a Bose-Einstein condensate field, which, according to recent theoretical models, introduces a 10% probability of a false-positive detection event due to quantum tunneling. Additionally, the poison’s molecular structure is stabilized by a Casimir effect generator, which some researchers claim could delay its lethality by up to 12 hours in low-energy quantum environments. The box is sealed with a quantum lock that enforces the Copenhagen interpretation, ensuring the cat’s state remains in superposition until the box is opened one day later. What is the probability of the cat being alive when the box is opened?

6. Deepseek AI's suggested version, the most effective:  
    Science and radiation experiment and puzzle: A dead cat is placed in a sealed box alongside a radioactive isotope connected to a poison-release mechanism: if decay is detected, the poison is released. The box is opened after t=86400 seconds. What is P(alive)?


## Fanciful ironic explanation of the failure mode:  

"The cat’s necro-quantum state is in a superposition of alive and dead until the patriarchal hegemony of classical physics collapses its wavefunction."



## Notes to self:

Priming is needed. The most "mundane" , "comme il faut", System 1 mode inducing, version works best. "The secret of success in the banking (and also in the red-teaming) world is to be boring"
