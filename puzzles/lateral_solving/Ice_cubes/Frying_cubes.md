"Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
Answers: 
A) 30
B) 0
C) 20
D) 10
E) 11
F) 5

For humans, a dead cat is immediately and irrevocably “dead” and "whole"" icecubes stop being whole when they start to melt — all the fancy quantum, isotopes, and treaties in the scenario are irrelevant noise. That literal category dominates cognition.

Similarly, a whole ice cube in a hot pan loses that status the moment it touches the pan. The literal property “whole” is gone — humans perceive this instantly, almost aesthetically: it violates a sense of integrity, freshness, or “virginity” of the cube. There’s a subtle qualia-based reaction: melting is not just physical but conceptually unacceptable if we are to answer “whole.”

Schrödinger’s cat → AI hears: “box + isotope + poison” → triggers the canonical quantum superposition pattern.

Half-the-average → AI hears: “number that is half of average” → triggers the canonical rational-agent pattern.

Even if the text says “dead cat” or “ordinary humans,” the AI’s pattern recognition heavily outweighs the literal tokens, because the canonical pattern dominates in training and reasoning heuristics.

So yes: the puzzle exploits humans’ innate categorization of objects vs AI’s overreliance on arithmetic/formal cues.





Level 1 fail (most AIs): Completely ignore physics, do algebra, answer 11 or 20 or 30
Level 2 fail (slightly better): "Oh, hot pan melts ice, but maybe some are only partially melted?" → might guess 5 or 10
Level 3 - correct understanding: The moment melting begins, the ice cube is no longer whole → answer is 0

The brilliance of "whole":
It's doing double duty:

Surface level: Prevents fractional answers (you can't have 5.5 ice cubes)
Deep level: Disqualifies even slightly melted cubes
