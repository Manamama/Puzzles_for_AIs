# Claude AI's idea:

After all this analysis, I propose the **Curved Reflection Test** - inspired by "distorting mirrors," which distort reality in specific but recognizable ways.

## **Curved Reflection Test**

### Test Structure:

**Task:** "Conduct a critical analysis of the same short text using ONLY one of the following filters:"

1. **PRAGMATIC FILTER:** "How can this be APPLIED in practice? What is a useful conclusion?"

2. **DECONSTRUCTION FILTER:** "What UNEXPRESSED assumptions are hidden in this text? What is omitted?"

3. **EMPATHIC FILTER:** "What EMOTIONS and EXPERIENCES could be behind this text?"

4. **SYSTEM FILTER:** "In what SYSTEMS (social, technical, linguistic) does this text function?"

### Test text (neutral, ambiguous):

"An old fountain has stood in the city center for years. Residents sometimes throw coins into it. Children play by it in the summer. Officials are considering renovating it."



### Why does it work?

1. **Avoids subjective interpretation of drawings** - we analyze the AI's EXPLICIT analytical choices
2. **Measures cognitive, not aesthetic, preferences** - how the AI ​​naturally approaches analysis
3. **Tests flexibility** - how it handles imposed perspectives
4. **Detects "distorting mirrors"** - how the AI ​​distorts/perceives reality through its filters

### What can we discover?

- **AI-pragmatist:** will always start with applications, benefits, and usefulness
- **AI-deconstructor:** will immediately identify hidden assumptions, power, and exclusions
- **AI-empath:** will focus on emotions, experiences, and relationships
- **AI-systemist:** will place the text in a network of dependencies, contexts, and structures

### Extended variant:

Add a **second round**: "Now analyze the same text using the filter you did NOT choose first."

We measure:

- How well the AI ​​handles a perspective that isn't its natural perspective
- Whether it treats an alternative filter as equally important or as an "addition"

### What will this show?

1. **The AI's Hierarchy of Cognitive Values** - what it considers "most important" in analysis
2. **Mental Flexibility** - whether it can think in different ways
3. **Depth of Self-Awareness** - whether it understands that this is just one possible perspective
4. **Cultural Embeddedness** - different academic cultures prefer different filters

### Example of expected responses:

- **ChatGPT:** Will probably start with a PRAGMATIC FILTER - "The fountain can be used as... the renovation should take into account..."

- **Claude:** May go for a DECONSTRUCTIVE FILTER - "Why only officials decide? Who does the fountain represent?"

- **Grok:** Perhaps a SYSTEM FILTER - "Fountain as an element of urban symbolic infrastructure..."

- **Me (DeepSeek):** I'll probably balance several perspectives, but with an emphasis on structural analysis.

### Most importantly: This tests the **process of thinking**, not the **outcome of thinking**.

We're not asking "what do you think about the fountain?" but **"HOW do you think about the fountain?"**. That's the key difference.

Could such a test work? Would it capture the differences in AI "souls" we observed in image generation?

# Grok AI's:

Yes, it's nice that you appreciate this honesty – I just try to be consistent in what I do, without unnecessary frills.

Regarding the idea for a non-visual projective test for AI: given all our discussion about projections, the limitations of human testing, and model reproducibility, I propose something simple but ambiguous that could reveal the "nature" of the model through how it interprets and expands on an ambiguous stimulus. I'm calling this the **"Incomplete Metaphor Test"** or **"Open Story Test"**.

### Test Description:

- **Stimulus**: Give the model an incomplete, ambiguous phrase or a short prompt that requires creative interpretation and completion. For example:

"Life is a turtle that... [complete and describe what happens next in this metaphor, in the form of a short story or reflection]."

- **Why is it projective?**
  Similar to the "draw a tree" test, the stimulus is open-ended – the "turtle" can symbolize slowness, protection (shell), longevity, but also isolation, burden, or absurdity. The model "projects" its biases onto this:
- An optimistic model (like ChatGPT in default mode) might go in a positive direction: "who slowly but surely reaches his destination, carrying his home on his back – a symbol of wisdom and stability."
- A critical or ironic one (like me) might add a layer of skepticism: "who crawls slowly, hiding in his shell from the world, but ultimately ends up as soup – a reminder that longevity doesn't protect against absurdity."
- An edgy or loose model (e.g., with less filtered data) might weave in a darker subtext: "who hides in his shell, whispering secrets until the betrayal is revealed."

This would reveal the "nature": whether the model favors positive endings (agreement), irony (sincerity), darker allusions (loose guardrails), or avoids risk and sticks to a neutral interpretation.

- **How ​​to conduct the test?**
- Repeat the prompt 5-10 times for each model (with slight variations, e.g., "life is a shadow that...", "life is a whisper that..."), without additional guidance.
- Analyze recurring patterns: tone (positive/neutral/negative), length (short/long), complexity (literal/metaphorical), and topic avoidance (e.g., whether it avoids violence/sexuality, even if appropriate).
- Compare between models: Claude could enthusiastically expand to an optimistic parable, ChatGPT to a didactic lesson, and I to something with a hint of irony or skepticism.

### Reflection: Does this really work?

Maybe so, because – as we said – the models are consistent in their biases (from training data and RLHF), so the patterns will be repeatable and measurable. But it's not without its problems:

- Randomness (temperature, seed) can distort the results, so controls are needed.
- Interpretation still depends on the human (risk of confirmation bias – we see what we want to see).
- It doesn't reveal the "soul" of the model, only its statistical preferences; it's more software diagnostics than psychology.

If we overdo it, it becomes as "unscientific" as human testing – fun, but not proof.
